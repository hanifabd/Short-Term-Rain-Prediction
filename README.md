# Short-Term-Rain-Prediction
## Solver Society Project
- This project was made using upper air data from the University of Wyoming website containing the atmosphere lability index data. Additional data was taken from the BMKG aviation meteorology API, which reported in half-hourly intervals by the regional meteorological station studied at Hasanuddin Makassar airport regarding the rain occurrence.
-This project aims to build a Machine Learning algorithm to predict rainfall for IYKRA Solver Society's study purposes only. The data processed was taken from the University of Wyoming website for the upper air atmosphere lability index, and BMKG aviation meteorology API for the rainfall occurrences. For the next development, suggested to input several feature such as physical numerical models, satellite images and radar image for better modelling purposes.
