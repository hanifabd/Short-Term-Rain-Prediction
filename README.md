# Short-Term-Rain-Prediction
## Solver Society Project
This project aims to build a Machine Learning algorithm to predict rainfall for IYKRA Solver Society's study purposes only.
The data processed was taken from the University of Wyoming website for the upper air atmosphere lability index, and BMKG aviation meteorology API for the rainfall occurrences.
For the next development, suggested to input several feature such as physical numerical models, satellite images and radar image for better modelling purposes.
